**Intuition:**
The problem aims to determine whether a person can attend all scheduled meetings without any time conflicts.
The intuition is to sort the intervals based on the start times. 
If the end time of one interval is greater than the start time of the next interval, it means there is a time conflict, and the person cannot attend all meetings.

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort the intervals in ascending order based on their start times.
2. Iterate through the sorted intervals from the first interval to the second-to-last interval. (To avoid beyond the valid range error)
3. For each, pair of consecutive intervals, check if the end time of the current interval is greater than the start time of the next interval.
   If so, return False. (Indicating a time conflict)
4. If no overlaps are found, return True.

```
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        intervals.sort()
        for i in range(len(intervals)-1):
            if intervals[i][1] > intervals[i+1][0]:
                return False
        return True
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n logn)
The solution has a time complexity of O(n logn) for sorting the intervals.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
The solution uses only constant additional space.
