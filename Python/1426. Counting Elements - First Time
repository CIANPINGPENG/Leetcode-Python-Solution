**Intuition:**
The intuition is to count the number of elements in the given array by creating a dictionary to store the frequencies of each element.
Then, it iterates over the keys in the array and checks if the key plus 1 is in the array.
If so, it increments the count by the frequency. 
Then, it returns the count.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create an empty dictionary to store the frequencies of elements.
2. Iterate over each element in the array.
   If an element is already a key in the dictionary, increment its frequency by 1.
   If an element is not a key in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.
3. Iterate over each key in the dictionary.
   Check if the key plus one is in the dictionary. If so, increment the count by the frequency of the key.
4. Return the count.

```
class Solution:
    def countElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = 0
        arr_set = {}
        
        for i in arr:
            if i in arr_set:
                arr_set[i] += 1
            else:
                arr_set[i] = 1
        for j in arr_set:
            if j+1 in arr_set:
                n+=arr_set[j]
        return n
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
The solution has a time complexity of O(n) for both iterations over the array and the dictionary.

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
The solution uses a dictionary to store all unique elements. 

**Improvement:**
Directly checking for the presence of the key plus one in the array to reduce the space complexity from O(n) to O(1).
