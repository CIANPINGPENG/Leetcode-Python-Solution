**Intuition:**
The problem aims to check whether a given list of words forms a valid word square.
A word square is a square arrangement of words such that the words read horizontally and vertically are the same.
The intuition is to construct the transpose of the given word list and check if it matches the original list.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize an empty list "transpose" to store the transposed words.
2. Iterate over the indices "i" from 0 to the length of the input "words".
3. for each "i", initialize an empty string "words_trans" to construct the transposed word.
4. Iterate over the indices "j" from 0 to the length of the word at index "i" in "words".
5. Check if both "j" and "i" are within the bounds of the indices of "words". If so, append the character at "words[j][i]" to "word_trans".
6. Append "word_trans" to the "transpose" list.
7. Check if "transpose" is equal to "words". If so, return "True".

class Solution:
    def validWordSquare(self, words: List[str]) -> bool:
        transpose = []
        for i in range(len(words)):
            words_trans = "" 
            for j in range(len(words[i])):
                print(1, i, j)
                if j < len(words) and i < len(words[j]):
                    print(2, i, j)
                    words_trans += words[j][i]
            transpose.append(words_trans)
        if transpose == words:
            return True
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
The solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) for nested loops over the number of words and characters in the input.

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
The solution uses additional space to store the transposed words in the "transpose" list.
