**Intuition:**
The intuition is to find the maximum sum of two numbers from the given list that is less than the target value.
To achieve this, the function sorts the list in ascending order and uses two pointers to traverse the list from both ends.

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort the list in ascending order.
2. Initialize variables num1 to 0 (representing the start of the list) and num2 to len(nums)-1 (represnting the end of the list).
3. Initialize variables max_val to a value that is guaranteed to be smaller than any possible sum of two numbers in the list.
4. Use a while loop to iterate until num1 is less than num2:
   a. Calculate the sum of the numbers at indices num1 and num2 and store it in sum_val.
   b. If sum_val is greater than or equal to k, devrement num2 to move to a smaller number and continue to the next iteration.
   c. If sum_val is less than k, compare it with max_val. If it is greater, update max_val to sum_val.
   d. Increment num1 to move to the next number in the list.
5. After the while loop, check if max_val is still equal to the initial value. If it is, no pair of numbers was found whose sum is less than k, so return -1.
   Otherwise, return max_val.

```
class Solution:
    def twoSumLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        num1 = 0
        num2 = len(nums)-1
        max_val = -100
        while num1 < num2:
            sum_val = nums[num1] + nums[num2]
            if sum_val >= k:
                num2 -= 1
            else:
                if sum_val > max_val:
                    max_val = sum_val
                num1 += 1
                
        if max_val == -100:
            return -1
        else:
            return max_val
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
The solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) for the sorting operation and the subsequent traversal of the list using two pointers takes linear time (O(n)).

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
The solution uses only constant additional space. 

**Improvement:**
Consider adding a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where the list has fewer than two elements.
