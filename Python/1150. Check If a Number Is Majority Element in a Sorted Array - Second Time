**Intuition:**
The intuition is to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
Then, we check if the most occurring element is same as the target and if the count of the target element is greater than half length of the array. 
If there is such an index, we return True. 

**Algorithm:**
1. Use the Counter function to count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. Iterate overe the items in the counter object using the items() method, which returns a tuple containing the element and its count.
3. For each item, check if the element is equal to the target value and if its count is greater than half of the length of the array.
   If both conditions are satisfied, return True to indicate that the target value is a majority element.
4. If the loop completes without finding a majority element, return False.

```
class Solution:
    def isMajorityElement(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        count_nums = Counter(nums)
        for val, count in count_nums.items():
            if val == target and count > len(nums)/2:
                return True
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
The solution only needs to iterate over the array once

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
The solution uses the counter object which requires additional space to store the counts of each element in the array.

**Improvement:**
Only need to identify the element which is same as the target and make the space complexity to O(1)
