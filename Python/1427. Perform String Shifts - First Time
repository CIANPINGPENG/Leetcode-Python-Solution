**Intuition:**
The intuition is to shift characters in a string based on the provided shift values.
I iterates over each character in th input string and applies the shifts sepecified in the list.
It keeps track of the updated positions of each character and then sorts them based on their positions to obtain the final shifted string.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize an empty list to store the updated positions and characters.
2. Iterate over each character and its corresponding index in the string.
3. For each shift in the list, update the index by subtracting or adding the shift amount based on the shift direction.
4. Adjust the index to stay within the bounds of the string using modulo operations.
5. Append the updated index and the corresponding character to the new list.
6. Sort the new list based on the indices.
7. Iterate over the sorted list and concatenate the characters to form the final result string.
8. Return the final result string.

```
        new=[]
        res=""
        for num, val in enumerate(s):
            for j in range(len(shift)):
                if shift[j][0] == 0:
                    num -= shift[j][1]
                else:
                    num += shift[j][1]
            while num > len(s) - 1 or num < 0:
                if num > len(s) - 1:
                    num -= len(s)
                elif num < 0:
                    num += len(s)
            new.append([num, val])
        new.sort()
        for k in range(len(new)):
            res+=new[k][1]
        return res
```

**Time Complexity:** O(nmlog(n))
The solution has a time complexity of O(nmlog(n)). 
O(n) is the length of the input string.
O(m) is the number of shifts in the list.
The sorting operation on the list takes O(log(n)) time.

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
The solution uses a list to store the updated positions and characters for each character. 

**Improvement:**
Calculating the total net shift amount and applying it to the string in a single step.
