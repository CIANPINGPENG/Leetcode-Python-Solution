**Intuition:**
The intuition is to determine if two sentences are similar based on a given list of similar word pairs.

**Algorithm:**
1. Check if sentence1 is equal to sentence2 and similarPairs is an empty list. 
   If both conditions are true, return True.
2. Check if the lengths of sentence1 and sentence2 are not equal. 
   If they are not equal, return False.
3. Iterate through each index in the range from 0 to the length of sentence1:
   a. Initialize empty list res1 and res2.
   b. If sentence1 is not equal to sentence2, add the pair to both empty lists in different order.
      Then, check if either list is not present in the similarPairs. If neither pair is found, return False.
4. If the loop completes without returning False, return True.

```
class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, sentence1: List[str], sentence2: List[str], similarPairs: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        if sentence1 == sentence2 and similarPairs == []:
            return True
        if len(sentence1) != len(sentence2):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(sentence1)):
            res1 = []
            res2 = []
            if sentence1[i] != sentence2[i]:
                res1.append([sentence1[i],sentence2[i]])
                res2.append([sentence2[i],sentence1[i]])        
                if res1[0] not in similarPairs and res2[0] not in similarPairs :
                    return False
        return True
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
The solution has a time complexity of O(n) for iterating through each word in the sentences once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
The solution uses only constant additional space as they are initialized inside the loop and contain at most one element. 

**Improvement:**
Consider using a dictionary to store the pairs, the lookup time could be reduced to constant time.
