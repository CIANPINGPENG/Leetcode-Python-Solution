**Intuition:**
The intuition is to find the largest subquerry of size k in a given list of integers.
The approach is to find the maximum number in the array and then create a subquery of size k with the maximum number at its starting index.

**Algorithm:**
1. Find the maximum number in the array.
2. Find the index of the maximum number.
3. Create a subquery of size k with the starting index as the index of the maximum number.

```
class Solution:
    def largestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        
        n = 0
        max_num = 0
        res = []
        for i in range(len(nums)-k+1):
            if nums[i] > max_num:
                max_num = nums[i]
        
        st_i = nums.index(max_num)
        for j in range(st_i,st_i+k):
            res.append(nums[j])
        return res
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n+k)
The solution has a time complexity of O(n) for finding the maximum number in the array and another O(k) for creating the subquery.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
The solution uses only constant additional space. 

**Improvement:**
Improve the time complexity from O(n+k) to O(n) by avoiding the need to search for the maximum element in the list by sliding window technique.
