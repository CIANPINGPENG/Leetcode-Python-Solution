**Intuition:**
The intuition is to find the index of each element from nums1 and nums2.
The indices are then added to a result list and returned.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize an empty list to store the indices.
2. Iterate through the nums1 list, starting with the first element:
    a. Use the index method to find the index of nums1 in nums2.
    b. Append the index to the empty list.
4. Return the result list.

```
class Solution:
    def anagramMappings(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        res=[]
        for i in nums1:
            index = nums2.index(i)
            res.append(index)
        return res
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n*m)
The solution has a time complexity of O(n) for iterating through the nums1 list.
In each iteration of the loop, the index method is used to search for the element in nums2, which has a time complexity of O(m).
Overall, it's O(n*m) 

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
The solution uses additional space to store the indices.

**Improvement:**
This implementation has a high time complexity because it uses the index method for each method, which involves searching the entire nums2 list.
To improve the performance, I could consider using dictionary.
This approach reduces the search time from O(n*m) to O(n+m) because dictionary lookups have constant time complexity on average.
